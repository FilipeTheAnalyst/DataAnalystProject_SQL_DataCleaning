# Data Cleaning in SQL
In this project I take [raw housing data](https://github.com/FilipeTheAnalyst/DataAnalystProject_SQL_DataCleaning/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx) and transform it in SQL Server in order to prepare the information for analysis purposes.

Here is the [file](https://github.com/FilipeTheAnalyst/DataAnalystProject_SQL_DataCleaning/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Portfolio%20Project%20Queries.sql) with the SQL queries used to perform changes to standardize the data.

## Dataset
